# CMC

CMC (Circularity Mesaures Calculator) is a Mathematica package. It contains functions useful to calculate different mesaures of circularity. With these functions it is possible to detect a highlighted region in an image, calculate its area, centroids in order to obtain several mesaures of circularity. It is also possible to export the mesaurses to an XLS spreadsheet.
